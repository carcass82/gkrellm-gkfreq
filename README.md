# gkrellm-gqfreq [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/carcass82/gkrellm-gkfreq.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/carcass82/gkrellm-gkfreq)

I loved this [GKrellM](http://gkrellm.srcbox.net/) plugin but the homepage is no longer online and i could not find a way to contact the original author.
Since the project was licensed under GPL2, i'm "adopting" and updating it.

Original gkfreq author:
*Brad Davis* <brad@peakunix.net>
